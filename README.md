# DataWrangling_Lab2_Group10
Repository for the Assessments of Data Wrangling

Welcome to our GitHub repository. This repository is intended for sharing and collaborating on our project files. 

**Branches**
We are currently using the main branch for our work. You can push your files directly to this branch or, if you'd prefer to avoid overwriting anything, we can create and work on separate branches.
- Main Branch: All files can be added here. If we stick to using this branch only, make sure to name your files clearly so everyone understands their purpose.
- Additional Branches: If necessary, we can create different branches later on to manage specific tasks or assessments.
  
**Python**
I assunme we'll being using Colab for our python code. A Colab file has already been set up in the main branch. To edit the Colab notebook:
- Open the file via github.
- Make your code changes.
- Save the file via colab as a copy on GitHub.

**SQL**
For SQL, I assume we are using DB Browser for SQLite since this is the dialect covered in our lectures. We can use a different dialect but please make sure everyone uses the same one for consistency.

Steps for working with SQL files:
- Download the .sqlite file to your PC via github.
- Make your changes.
- Rename the file when saving it, so it's clear who made changes or when the file was last updated.

**Documentation**
We also need to provide an overview of our work in PDF format. We can use either Google Docs or Microsoft Word for this.

A link to our shared Word document can already be found in the main branch.
